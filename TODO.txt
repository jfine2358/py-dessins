I've added dessins/__init.py to solve pytest producing
E   SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-django/issues/303

It might be nice to have set operation
  (A, B) => (A - B, B - A, A intersect B)
And it could do something similar for triples, etc.

For set differences, I'd like to add __slots__. But I get
TypeError: nonempty __slots__ not supported for subtype

See also http://bugs.python.org/issue757997 (from 2003).
Using __slots__ with str derived classes can cause segfault
